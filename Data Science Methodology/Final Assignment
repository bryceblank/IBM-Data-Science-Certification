Analyzing Credit Cards Default

Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to?
My Answer: 

Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer.
You are required to:

Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.
Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.
My Answer: Many banks and credit card companies have a high risk in that their clients will default on their credit card payment or not. Especially, banks want to reduce this risk by building a model that utilizes features that they have in their database about each individual.

So the question for this project would be, "Can we predict whether a customer or client will default on their payment based on given features?"
